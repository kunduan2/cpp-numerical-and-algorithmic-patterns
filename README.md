# C++ Algorithms and Systems Programming

This repository contains C++ implementations of core algorithms, data structures, and language features, written to understand **performance, memory behavior, and correctness from first principles**.

The emphasis is on clear problem formulation, mathematically grounded solutions, and idiomatic modern C++.

## Status

This repository is under active development.
New implementations and refinements are added incrementally as concepts are studied and validated.
Existing files may be refactored as understanding deepens.

## Focus areas

- **Modern C++**
  - RAII and resource management
  - Move semantics
  - Const correctness and value vs reference semantics
- **Algorithms and data structures**
  - Classical algorithms with complexity analysis
  - Core data structure implementations
- **Numerical methods and linear algebra**
  - Root finding and optimization
  - Finite-difference methods
  - Matrix factorizations and least-squares problems
- **Low-level behavior**
  - Memory layout and ownership
  - Performance-aware design
